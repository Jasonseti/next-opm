      "title": "One Punch",
      "brief_summary": "Vaccine Man attacks A-City, killing many, but Saitama rescues a girl from him and kills the monster with a single punch, leaving Saitama frustrated by the lack of challenge.",
      "long_summary": "A quiet and peaceful A-City is suddenly disturbed by an enormous blast that obliterates the surrounding area. Standing in the crater the blast left behind, is Vaccine Man. He slowly takes flight, powers up and fires multiple blasts at the city below. The energy blasts destroy the buildings and kill a large number of civilians. Meanwhile, Saitama is at home and watches the news, where the destruction and mayhem are being reported live. Saitama decides to stop it.\nNear Vaccine Man, a schoolgirl is seen crying for her parents. Vaccine Man approaches her and seems to lend her a hand, but the hand suddenly transforms into a monstrous claw and reaches for the girl. Luckily, she is saved by an incoming Saitama, who grabs the girl and dashes away from the monster. Vaccine Man asks for Saitama to identify himself and he does, by saying that he's just an average man acting as an average hero. The creature is angered by this and aggressively tells the tale of who he is and where he came from. He transforms into a much larger and much more vicious version of himself and looms over Saitama. Saitama however, is completely unfazed and throws a punch, instantly blowing a hole in the monster, killing it. Realizing that the fight ended with one punch again, Saitama yells in frustration.",

Inspired to become a hero, he begins his training; in the present, now bald and unbeatable, he reflects that his strength still leaves him unsatisfied.",
      "long_summary": "Three years before the setting of the start of the series, Saitama, with a full head of hair, has an encounter with the Mysterious Being Crablante. Saitama stands before Crablante, who seems surprised that he is not running in fear like the other people, Saitama sighs and Crablante comes to the conclusion that Saitama is a salary man and due to the fact that he isn't running, he must want to die. Saitama agrees with that but states that he is, in fact, unemployed and is on a job hunt and that he had already been rejected from a job that morning. Saying that he has lifeless eyes like himself, Crablante decides to let him off the hook, stating that his real prey is a child with a cleft chin.\nCrablante walks away and Saitama notices a child playing with a soccer ball in the park next to him, a child with a cleft chin. Saitama asks the kid if he did anything to a crab monster and the kid agrees, saying that he drew nipples on the monster with a permanent marker. At that moment Crablante appears behind Saitama and goes to attack the child, but Saitama dives and saves the kid. Saitama says the kid needs to run, but the kid says he wants his ball. Crablante is confused, as to why Saitama is trying to save the child, and that at this point it's too late to stop because he'd butchered some people on his way there, and that he'll do the same to anyone who makes fun of him. Crablante is in the middle of a rant when Saitama starts laughing, stating that Crablante reminded him of a villain from an anime he'd watched as a kid at which point Crablante hits him and sends him flying. Crablante goes to attack the child and is about to do so, but gets hit in the head with a stone thrown by Saitama. Saitama states that he remembers his dream as a child had been to be a hero who could beat any villain with one punch, and he throws off his coat and wraps his tie around his hand and challenges Crablante. Crablante starts to beat Saitama up, hitting him once, twice, but before he can hit him a third time, Saitama loops his tie around Crablante's eye stalk and rips it out of his head, killing him.\nThree years later Saitama, now super-powered and bald, is recalling the events of those days and that even though he obtained an unbeatable power he is still unsatisfied.",

      "long_summary": "The chapter opens on Fukegao, who has just finished his new, ultimate steroid, Biceps Brachii King. Fukegao gives his new steroid to his little brother, Marugori, claiming that it will make him the strongest man alive. Marugori drinks the drug and his body immediately starts to transform, growing till he crashes through the ceiling and becomes taller than the surrounding hills. Marugori picks his brother out of the rubble of the building and sets him on his shoulder, who then proclaims them The Brain and Brawn Brothers, the strongest, most intelligent group in the world. The two of them head to the nearest civilization, D-City, the entirety of which he destroys in one swing of his arm, Fukegao then says to go on and destroy the next city.\nThe country is in an uproar and multiple news stations report the disaster. As they head to the next town, B-City, Fukegao notices that there is someone sitting on Marugori's other shoulder, that someone being Saitama. Marugori mistakes which shoulder Saitama is on and accidentally swats the wrong shoulder where his brother is on, killing him instantly. When Marugori finds out whom he has killed, it was not Saitama whom he has killed but was his older brother Fukegao. After this, He then freaks out, lamenting that all he'd wanted was to have more power, and blames his brother's death on Saitama, grabbing him off of his shoulder and throwing him to the ground with all his anger. Saitama begins to get up and brush himself off when Marugori jumps on top of him and starts pounding Saitama back to the ground, leaving a gigantic hole. Thinking he victoriously defeated him, Marugori recalls feeling empty inside despite being the strongest, with Saitama agreeing, jumps out of the giant hole and then punches Marugori in the face, killing him, landing Marugori on to the B-City, accidentally destroying it.",

Saitama then rushes into the group of enemies, fighting madly until all of the Subterranean People are dead at his feet. As Saitama is standing there on the corpses, he hears a voice behind him and turns to see the Subterranean King bursting through the ground and is about to fight him when he hears his alarm clock go off and wakes from his dream. Sitting there stunned and disappointed he hears the Subterranean King yelling outside, so he goes and kicks him in the face, killing him in one hit. He declares that he will protect the surface and is about to fight the Subterranean People, but finds that they have already retreated back underground, leaving a white flag with the words \"We're Sorry\" on it. Saitama is left severely disappointed.",

When he lifts his hand, the mosquito flies away, so he swats at it a few more times, missing each time and getting very angry that he can't hit it. The mosquito then flies off and meets up with Mosquito Girl. Saitama then turns on the news to see that there is a mass mosquito outbreak and that it is heading towards Z-City, at a disaster level of Demon. A man is shown outside stealing from a store, mocking all the people who evacuated when a strong wind blows his hat off from behind. The man is then surrounded by mosquitoes who then suck all of his blood, and leave him an emaciated corpse. These mosquito's then fly off to give the blood to Mosquito Girl, who complains that it is not nearly enough. She then notices a figure shrouded in her mosquitoes, so she sends more of them to the figure who then destroys them all and reveals himself to be the cyborg Genos. Saitama is then shown attempting to kill another mosquito but failing.",

As she flies away, she notices that her legs are gone below the knees and looks down to see Genos tossing them onto the ground, she then sends more mosquitoes at Genos so she can fly away.\nWhile Genos is distracted, she calls all of her mosquitoes to give her blood. Genos is about to attack the mass of mosquitoes surrounding Mosquito Girl when he hears someone yelling and turns to see Saitama running onto the street, Genos tells him to hide or he may die. At that moment all the mosquitoes swarm down towards Genos and Saitama, all of which get destroyed by Genos, creating a massive explosion and fireball. Genos then realizes about Saitama, thinking that he killed him in the explosion, but is shocked to see Saitama standing there unfazed, but completely naked.\nMosquito Girl, now more powerful, attacks Genos, ripping him almost in half at the chest. Genos then spins around and attempts to punch Mosquito Girl, but she dodges his attack easily and starts to attack him mercilessly eventually cutting off both his legs and shredding his torso in half. Genos begins to fall to the ground and decides that he will self-destruct to destroy her and is about to when Saitama slaps Mosquito Girl in the face, sending her flying through a building and into the distance,after that,offhandedly remarking that he hates mosquitoes. Genos then asks Saitama his name and to be his disciple.",

The scene shifts to a building in a mountainous area with two men talking about Mosquito Girl's defeat, the men then express interest in Saitama's strength and decides to send him an \"invitation\" to the House of Evolution. The scene shifts back to Genos asking Saitama to teach him how to become strong, Saitama asks Genos if he's ready for the training, and Genos agrees.\nGenos then senses a presence drawing close to the apartment quickly. At that moment Kamakyuri bursts through the ceiling and is killed instantly by Saitama before he can even say who he is. Genos mentions that there are more beings outside, so they leave the apartment to find Frog Man and Slugerous. Genos steps forward to take them out, but Saitama beats him to it, burying them upside down to their chests in the sidewalk. A hand then bursts out of the ground, grabs Saitama's ankle and pulls him underground until all that's visible is his head and neck, which he compares to being a plant growing through the concrete. Genos begins to rush to Saitama's aid when the cyborg Armored Gorilla bursts through a wall behind him.",

A young Mumen Rider, then calling himself \"Nameless Bicycle Commuter\" shows up and attempts to stop the two delinquents. A day after the incident, Saitama relaxes in bed while watching a news report about an escaped Mysterious Being. The following day, a teacher berates Saitama for not doing his homework and tells him to meet him in the teachers' lounge after school. \nAt the end of the school day, Saitama is stopped by the two delinquents known as the \"Ripped Uniforms.\" When Saitama tries to confront them, they beat him and steal 200 yen. Suddenly, the escaped Mysterious Being, Piggy Bancon appears, demanding coins. The delinquents hand over Saitama's money. One laments that he can no longer afford his little brother's lunch, at which point Saitama chases after the monster. He catches up but is knocked unconscious for over an hour. Upon awakening, he heads to the teachers' lounge, only to be reprimanded for being late. Leaving the school, Saitama wonders if he is too weak to live his life properly. The scene then shifts to a present-day Saitama walking on a snowy hill while carrying a child on his shoulders, who expresses his fear of the future. Saitama offers reassurance by explaining how he believes there is no right way to live in the world, despite how strong you are. The child then points to a large snow monster ahead and asks if Saitama can beat it. All of a sudden, Saitama panics as he realizes that he forgot to take out the trash.",

Dr. Genus figured how to make himself young again, learned how to clone himself and began his experimentation to advance evolution, naming his lab the House of Evolution. Saitama interrupts Armored Gorilla at this point in his explanation, so Armored Gorilla tells Saitama and Genos that Dr. Genus has taken an interest in Saitama's body, so they decide to head straight to their base and stop them. As they are about to leave, Armored Gorilla sends a signal to Dr. Genus, who is shocked at the fact that his creations are destroyed, and tells his clones to make preparations to release Carnage Kabuto.\nFour hours later, Saitama and Genos are running up a mountainside and arrive at the House of Evolution's base, which Genos promptly decides to destroy, along with part of the mountains in the distance. Saitama notices a hatch on the ground amidst all of the rubble, Saitama rips the hatch open and they decide to go inside. The scene shifts to show one of Dr. Genus' clones extremely frightened, firing a gun, who then gets punched and explodes. The real Dr. Genus then walks into the room and greets Carnage Kabuto, who is surrounded by the dead bodies of clones, Carnage Kabuto casually breaks off his restraints and proclaims himself the \"New Human,\" Dr. Genus then shows him a picture of Saitama and Genos, asking him to get Saitama's body, dead or alive.",

Genos mentions how he can sense many lifeforms in the compound, and two lifeforms coming towards them down the tunnel. Carnage Kabuto appears carrying Dr. Genus, who after telling Carnage Kabuto which of the two was Saitama gets thrown to the side. Carnage Kabuto then smashes Genos into the wall and continues down the hall until he is behind Saitama, leaving Genos embedded in the wall. Carnage Kabuto introduces himself to Saitama and tells him that there's a large nearby room where they can fight, Saitama agrees to follow on the grounds of Carnage Kabuto making Genos look like \"modern art\".\nThe two arrive in the room and the fight is about to start when a large blast of fire washes over Carnage Kabuto, that came from Genos who appears in the doorway. Genos then rushes at Carnage Kabuto and sends a barrage of punches his way, these have little to no effect on him as he simply punches Genos in the face and sends him bouncing off the ground and across the room only to be caught by Saitama. Saitama tries to get Genos to stop, but he lets out another blast at Carnage Kabuto, who simply takes a deep breath and uses his breath to blow the blast back at Genos, which then washes over him and makes his hair poof in the shape of an Afro. Saitama then steps in to fight with Dr. Genus watching from the doorway, and Carnage Kabuto mentions how he can feel that Saitama is very strong. Carnage Kabuto then, at blinding speeds, moves behind Saitama and is about to attack him when he senses Saitama's aura which causes him to jump back in fear, thinking that if he had attacked he would have been killed easily. Carnage Kabuto then yells at Saitama, asking him how he became so powerful. Saitama agrees to tell him and asks Genos to listen up as well.",

      "long_summary": "Saitama begins to tell Genos and Carnage Kabuto the secret to his power, revealing that the key is that no matter what, one must see the training through to the end. He then goes on to say, rather seriously, that he became as strong as he is by doing 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats and 10 kilometers of running every day, he then goes on to give other advice such as eating healthy and never using an air conditioner be it summer or winter to strengthen one's mental fortitude. Saitama then concludes his speech by saying that the true power of humanity is not messing around with evolution, but their ability to change themselves on their own. Genos then gets up, yelling at Saitama, telling him to stop being ridiculous and stating that the training regimen that Saitama had described was standard BOG strength training and isn't even all that hard. Saitama is confused by this, because he told Genos all that he'd done to become strong.\nCarnage Kabuto, believing that Saitama was making fun of him, goes berserk and enters Asura Mode. Carnage Kabuto states that while in this form he will go on a rampage for a whole week, destroying town after town until next Saturday. Carnage Kabuto then rushes forward and starts to pummel Saitama, beating him around the room mercilessly. During this barrage of attacks, Saitama realizes that he had mistaken the day and missed the special sale at the store, freaks out and punches Carnage Kabuto's head off, along with most of his torso. Dr. Genus, who witnessed the entire event, decides that evolution isn't the way to change, it is he himself who needs to change.",

      "long_summary": "The leader of the Paradise Group, Hammerhead gives out a speech about how to work sucks and that only those who want to work should have to. When one of his subordinates mentions that no one is listening to him, Hammerhead gets angry and says to show them how serious they are, they will level the home of the multi-millionaire Zeniru. They get to a skyscraper and level it with one punch using stolen battle suits. One of Hammerheads henchmen then reveals that they destroyed the wrong building and that Zeniru's mansion is further down the road. The group is about to head on towards Zeniru's mansion when the superhero Mumen Rider shows up to stop them. However, he is quickly defeated.\nThe scene shifts to Saitama waking up rather dramatically from a dream involving snotty fingers. He turns on his television to see a report mentioning Hammerhead and the activities of the Paradise Group and begins to brush his teeth, ignoring the report until they mention that Hammerhead and his group are all bald and that citizens should watch out for bald people on the streets, at which point, Saitama gets very serious and rushes out to stop the group. As Hammerhead and his posse run rampant through the streets to get to Zeniru's mansion, Zeniru prepares to leave his mansion in preparation for the terrorists to arrive when his bodyguard Speed-o'-Sound Sonic appears in the window of his room saying that he will take care of the terrorists. The Paradise Group finally arrives at the grounds of Zeniru's mansion and begins to head through the property when Hammerhead stops them partway up the path. Sonic then appears in front of the group and threatens them all with death. Meanwhile, in his search for the Paradise Group, Saitama is getting mistaken for one of them and is getting rather frustrated.",

He then smashes the ground causing a massive shock wave, which ultimately does nothing to Sonic who then taunts him from a nearby tree. Knowing where Sonic is now, Hammerhead throws a large boulder at Sonic who dodges easily, the boulder continuing on until it smashes the roof of Zeniru's skyscraper. As Sonic lands on the ground after dodging the boulder he narrowly avoids a second boulder aimed at where he was to land. He looks up and sees several more boulders flying at him and dodges them all.\nHammerhead then shows up, pushing through several trees, and taunts Sonic. Sonic then notices that all the boulders have \"conveniently\" made a direct path from Sonic to Hammerhead. Hammerhead lifts another rock and taunts Sonic again, so Sonic gets in an attack stance and rushes forward. Hammerhead drops the rock and picks up and smashes a tree down onto the path he'd made, but is then hit in the back of the head with a kunai by Sonic who'd managed to get behind him. Sonic takes out his phone and calls Zeniru to confirm Hammerheads death, but looks back and sees that Hammerhead is gone. Hammerhead, managing to survive thanks to his thick skull, runs away through the woods until he comes upon Saitama.",

      "long_summary": "Saitama, looking for the Paradise Group had ended up in the woods outside Zeniru's mansion, when he comes upon Hammerhead. Hammerhead stops in front of Saitama, who then challenges him to a fight. Hammerhead throws a punch and smashes Saitama in the face, but it hardly even moved him and only left him with a mildly perplexed look on his face. Saitama expresses his disappointment in Hammerheads strength. This enrages Hammerhead who then puts his suit on full power and uses his \"windmill attack,\" which reminds Saitama of how he used to fight as a child. Saitama then reaches out and easily stops Hammerheads attack and then punches him in the stomach, causing his suit to shatter. Hammerhead then runs off in the nude, promising to not do anything bad anymore.\nAt that point, Speed-o'-Sound Sonic arrives and asks where Hammerhead went. Sonic then throws a kunai at Saitama who catches it and then attempts to stab Saitama who stops him by grabbing the blade and breaking it. Saitama attempts to explain that he isn't a member of The Paradise Group but is instead a superhero, but Sonic doesn't believe him. Sonic then notes that the problem now isn't who Saitama is, but instead the fact that Saitama had managed to block two of his attacks. Sonic then challenges Saitama, stating that his pride won't allow him to lose, but Saitama then calls him out on the fact that he just wants to try out techniques on him and that he could tell by the childlike smile on his face. The scene then shifts to Hammerhead, who is being beaten up by two robots. The robots berate him for stealing the battle suits from \"The Organization\" and then leave him for dead.",

Several moments later, Sonic stands in front of Saitama, practically crossing his legs in pain, and declares him his rival.\nSome time later, Saitama is back in his apartment, talking to Genos about the incident with Saitama expressing his disappointment that Sonic hadn't heard of him, and his general lack of fame. Genos then tells Saitama about The National Super Hero Registry, something that if someone is not a part of, they won't be recognized as a hero. Saitama had never heard of this before, because it was founded after he became a hero, so the two decide to register themselves.",

      "long_summary": "This story takes place when Saitama was still training to become a hero and had hair. Saitama has saved an old lady from a mysterious being, and is rewarded with a year worth supply of candy. Afterwards he thinks of how he has taken down over 10 mysterious beings since he became a hero for a hobby, and how he is not doing it for the gratitude but it does help him, and even how he has been pushing his body to the limits.\nAt his 300th day of training. Saitama starts to feel an unbearable stinging pain. As he does his daily jogging, he is shown to move at high speed, and thinks of how he is gradually getting used to the training, and how it even gave him a boost in his physical fitness, showing what he can do by saving a child from a speeding car, crushing it's hood in the process. Disciplining the child about road safety, while people around are awing at his amazing feat.\nContinuing his thought of his growth, Saitama claims that he is able to move of how he thought superheroes would but there is still one flaw to his training, the stinging pain, which became more frequent. A Mysterious Being then appears, boasting of how strong it is, and destroying a nearby vehicle, with rapid punches. Saitama approaches the being, but is unsure of his success, because of the pain. The mysterious being is revealed to be the Tiger level monster Personification Of A Light Pull Cord, who talks of how he has changed and claims to be a \"God\" level threat. Personification Of A Light Pull Cord then complains about how unsatisfied he is attacking inanimate objects and wants to attack people. Personification Of A Light Pull Cord then notices Saitama coming from behind to attack him, and as Saitama is distracted by his stinging pain, the monster punches him through a truck and into a wall. Saitama then thinks he is at his limits, but then is determined to continue as he has not came so far for nothing. Then before Saitama is even capable of returning to the fight, Personification Of A Light Pull Cord attacks him with his Pull Cord Rush. Saitama then appears to be down, and a tooth falls out of his mouth. Saitama then recuperates, much to Personification Of A Light Pull Cord's surprise. Feeling much better now that his decaying tooth is out (which was the origin of his stinging pain), Saitama beats Personification Of A Light Pull Cord.\nBack to the original story line time. Saitama is seen leaving the bathroom, after seemingly brushing his teeth, and thinks of how maintaining healthy teeth prevents tooth decay.",

      "long_summary": "At the National Superhero Registry exam, Saitama is passing the physical exams without any trouble, amazing the other contestants by his immeasurable speed, endurance and arm and leg strength, breaking every superhero record in the process. In the locker room, Saitama meets up with Genos. They agree that the tests were a walk in the park and Genos adds that the written test was especially easy and thus the fitness test would be the deciding one. One hour later, they get their results, with Genos scoring perfectly everything, 100 points, and being ranked an S-Class Superhero. Saitama however, only got 71 points, ranking as a C-Class. He aced the fitness test, but barely managed to pass the written test. They are then both summoned to a seminar for the passing candidates.\nAt the meeting hall, they are greeted by Sneck, who congratulates them and gives them a lecture as to what being a superhero is all about. He is irritated by Saitama's nonchalance and yells that they should learn from him to become fine superheroes. Still annoyed by Saitama's dull look, Sneck implies that he can make sure that Saitama loses his rank. Saitama, as always, is completely and utterly uninterested. On their way home, Genos seems happy about them attaining a superhero rank, figuring that this makes him Saitama's official disciple. Saitama is worried about this and regrets making Genos his disciple.\nBack at the office of the Hero Association, Sneck complains about the two new superheroes to Jinzuren. He says that they will probably both quit their jobs soon, but his partner disagrees, saying that Genos is already S-Class, above Sneck, and that both recruits got full points on the fitness test. He further presses that Saitama broke every fitness record and that he may surpass Sneck in no time. Meanwhile, walking on the riverside, Saitama is thinking about the Superhero ranks and revises his opinion about Genos, reasoning that he may actually be pretty impressive. However, he thinks to himself that Genos is not the kind of superhero Saitama wants to be. Suddenly, he is cut off by Sneck, who takes a fighting stance in front of him. He declares that he will fight Saitama because he is a promising newbie, a thing common in the industry. He initiates his hand-to-hand combat technique and connects with Saitama's face, though after an off screen, but brief, conflict, Sneck's torso is seen buried in the ground, with his legs sticking out and Saitama walking away.",

      "long_summary": "Genos is checking his and Saitama's new rankings in the Hero Registry, claiming that they'd been both put in the lowest rank of the S-Class (Genos) and C-Class (Saitama). After a brief discussion, it turns out that the two have gone to a quarry to spar. Genos asks Saitama to take the spar seriously and then takes a stance.\nHe holds out an arm, which opens up to reveal multiple cannons, which surprises Saitama. Genos fires a massive beam towards Saitama and then launches himself after the beam. Saitama easily sidesteps the beam but gets caught by Genos which causes the two of them to go flying into the wall of the quarry, shortly followed by the beam. Genos then moves along the side of the wall of the quarry, throwing a flurry of punches until he notices that Saitama isn't there and he'd just been attacking Saitama's afterimage the entire time.\nAfter realizing that he hadn't actually been attacking Saitama, Genos scans for him and locates him jogging away across the floor of the quarry and launches himself after him. Genos lands in front of Saitama and puts his hands together, both of which open up, and launch a massive blast. Genos thinks he'd managed to get Saitama, but Saitama pats Genos' shoulder and then pokes him on the cheek. Genos then throws a punch at Saitama, who dodges, and accuses him of not taking the spar seriously. At that point, Saitama gets rather close to Genos, who attempts to kick at him, but Saitama dodges behind Genos and throws a punch, stopping just before Genos' face, instead flicking him on the forehead. As Saitama walks away, Genos looks behind him to see a massive dust cloud caused by Saitama's punch.",

Afterwords, Saitama is relaxing and Genos is taking notes on everything Saitama does in hopes to learn the secret of his power. Saitama starts to think of ways to get Genos out, but is interrupted by Genos who tells him that C-Class heroes get expelled from the organization if they have been inactive for more than a week. Saitama had not known this and rushes out of the apartment to find a crime to solve. Saitama rushes all through out town, but doesn't find anything and gives up. The next day he does the same thing and is freaking out about being expelled when he catches a kunai that was thrown at him by Sonic, who's name he'd forgotten.",

      "long_summary": "Speed-o'-Sound Sonic tells Saitama that this time, he shall finally kill him, but before he is able to finish his sentence, Saitama tells him he is busy and cannot fight him at the time. Leaving Saitama irritates Sonic and thus even promotes him to attack Saitama with his sword, which the latter then shatters with his mouth, much to Sonic's surprise. Saitama who was already kind of annoyed by his unsuccessful search for heroic deeds to do, tells Sonic to back off or else he'll punch him. The two are then spotted by a girl who tells someone that one of them is a \"suspicious person\", that person then reveals himself to be the (C-Class Rank 6) hero Tanktop Tiger. Hearing that he is a hero, Saitama is convinced to he came to stop Sonic, for attacking him out of nowhere. However, Tanktop Tiger reveals his target was Saitama, who was walking around town with a \"suspicious\" look on his face since the day before. Hearing that he is the one they were talking about, Saitama tells Tanktop Tiger he is a pro-hero like him, Tanktop Tiger then tells him he has never heard of a hero that looks like him, to which Saitama answers that he is a newcomer.\nTanktop Tiger does not care and tells him to go back where he came from, for he is bothering people, which is bad for the heroes reputation. Tanktop Tiger then prompts Saitama to fight him if he does not leave, Tanktop Tiger is then being recognized for being in the top 10 of even C-Class. Tanktop tiger is then hit with Sonic's Exploding Shuriken, and is knocked out, which terrifies the people around, causing them all to run. Saitama worried for the fallen hero, talks to Sonic about his attack, to which he replies that he only put Tanktop Tiger to \"sleep\" for he got in their way. The civilians terrified of Sonic, are running around and calling for heroes to help them, which causes Sonic to tell Saitama that since he is also a \"hero,\" that he shall create a situation for the latter to fight him. Sonic then goes behind Saitama and in the air, throwing more exploding shurikens, to which the hero prepares but is shocked to learn they were not aimed at him, Sonic was actually using his - Slaughtering Mayhem Formation at the area around, causing havoc. A lot of damage is done, and people seem terrified, Saitama tells Sonic to stop but he does not listen, telling Saitama that if he won't fight him, then he shall continue with his destructive way. Saitama then saves a child from a falling car, by bending a tree over him, annoyed that everyone seems to get in his way, which he as no time for because he needs to find a bad guy to beat down. Saitama then notices Sonic and the havoc he had caused, and hits the latter to the ground, saying that he hopes said act takes care of his weekly quota.",

      "long_summary": "Spring Mustachio and Golden Ball are assigned to investigate the outskirts of Z-City. They discuss how the number of monsters in the city has been steadily increasing over the years. At the Hero Association headquarters, the staff oversee all of the investigations. Q-City is revealed to be the most dangerous city because of the large number of monsters. However, Watchdog Man seems to have no problem dealing with the monsters. The reports from cities W-City, H-City, and D-City stated that they encountered no problems. These regular investigations started to try to prevent potential threats. The report from F-City stated that Sneck found Hammerhead and that he will do further investigations. The staff members mention that Z-City's number of monsters is extremely high compared to other cities'. While Spring Mustachio and Golden Ball were investigating the ghost town, they sensed something nearby. The A-Class heroes encounter Kombu Infinity.\nGolden Ball takes the initiative and attacks first. His bullet is effortlessly swatted away, and Kombu Infinity grabs Golden Ball through the pavement and into a building, ultimately knocking Golden Ball out. Afterwards, Kombu Infinity attacks Spring Mustachio, but Spring Mustachio is able to parry all of his attacks. Spring Mustachio then launches his Tomboy attack. Unfortunately, Kombu Infinity manages to dodge it. Spring Mustachio resorts to calling for backup. Kombu Infinity reveals that there has been a rumor that extremely strong monsters have been gathering in the outskirts of Z-City. Despite, coming to meet the rumored monsters, Kombu Infinity decided to give up on that goal and become the rumored monster himself. Heroes received Spring Mustachio's call for reinforcements, and Blue Fire decides to go. Spring Mustachio is eventually defeated, thus leaving Kombu Infinity with nothing to do. Kombu Infinity ends up changing his mind and decides to go to an inhabited part of town. Sadly for Kombu Infinity, he encounters Saitama before he can go anywhere and is defeated by Saitama. In an unknown location, some monsters talk to each other about the monsters that live in Z-City. A silhouette of the elite monsters is shown. Back at home, Saitama cooks Kombu soup. Luckily for Kombu Infinity, Saitama spared Kombu Infinity's life and only took his Kombu hair. Genos mentions that the rumor that eating its hair will not grow one's hair, and Saitama becomes enraged.",

      "long_summary": "The story takes place during Saitama's first year and a half of training.\nIn Z-City, a crowd seen in Shelter No.7 hiding from the Mysterious Being - 170,000-Year-Old Cicada Larva. C-Class Rank 140 Red Muffler, and C-Class Rank 299 Grad School Graduate are fighting Cicada Larva, but with great difficulty as they are unable to harm it, and barely even hit it. Another hero then appears, with great confidence, claiming he shall defeat the monster, he is revealed to be Darkness Blade, a promising young rookie (at the time). Coming into the shelter, beaten, the pro heroes are ridiculed by the citizens, with Grad School Graduate even thinking of quitting. Red Muffler claims the creature is unbeatable and suggests everyone just wait for it to die of old age, to which some citizens reply that it can take 170,000 years, while Grad School Graduate then also explains that while they were unable to defeat the monster, they did show some lost citizens the path to the shelter, to which those citizens are grateful, while some others are still bothered by the fact that while Mysterious Beings are appearing more often, so do weak heroes who come to fight them. Saitama is then shown, realizing he is in a shelter, instead of fighting the monster, which is why he even followed the heroes, while trying to leave, he is then noticed by a man, who thinks he became suicidal. The man and a few others try to stop Saitama from leaving the shelter, and one even pulls some of his hair out. The people then call the guards, and a staff member of the Hero Association tells him that he shouldn't worry, as he is safe, not permitting him to go out when he asks and continuing to ensure the citizens of their safety with a megaphone, even claiming the Shelter to be \"Flawless\".\nSaitama notices he has to use the toilet, but cannot find it. He then asks the female staff member about the location of said \"Flawless\" shelter's bathroom, to which she replies there is none, which Saitama states is a huge flaw. One hour later, Saitama is struggling with his filled bladder, a person on the phone, proceeds that the Mysterious Being threat level has risen to Demon, after defeating 2 A-Class heroes that came to beat it, and that they now must wait for the newly formed \"subjugation squad\", which will arrive in 3 hours. Hearing that, Saitama moves rashly and proceeds to punch a hole in a wall, saying that he's going to the convenience store, much to the people's surprise. Saitama is then seen running towards the convenience store, and is interrupted by the Cicada Larva, who is swiftly killed by the rushing Saitama.\nAt the present day, Saitama sees a 170,000-Year-Old Cicada Adult flying in the sky and notes the arrival of summer.",

      "title": "A New Wind Blows | Volume 3 Extras",
      "brief_summary": "Glasses, a new B-Class hero in the Blizzard Group, helps capture arsonist Banero but is criticized for incompetence. Later, the group fights Demonic Fan, and Fubuki is defeated. Saitama then arrives, easily destroys the creature, and tells Glasses he just hasn't trained enough. Glasses eventually quits the group but continues working as a hero.",
      "long_summary": "Glasses is a B-Class professional hero who recently joined the Blizzard Group. While on patrol, he was watching Sweet Mask's interview on a giant screen in the city square about his philosophy of being a hero and promoting his new movie.\nGlasses is then lectured by Eyelashes for looking away, because he may lose sight of their target. Their target was the C-Class criminal Banero, a red hooded serial arsonist, who apparently was worth some points for heroes. Glasses is troubled because on that day there was also a special sale on vegetables, eventually thinking back to a time when he was an office worker, and life was hard, and that one day on the train, he noticed the Hero Association advertisement.\nBanero is surrounded by the Blizzard Group, who tell him to surrender, and if he does not, they'll attack. Banero mocks the heroes for how they all wear the same black suits. Eyelashes then tells him that it is their team color. While the Blizzard Group fights Banero, who uses Molotov cocktails as a weapon, Glasses thinks of how even in the Hero Association there are factions, and how the Blizzard Group which is pulling the strings behind B-Class is the biggest one, and how he had to join them. After the defeat of Banero, the members of the Blizzard Group are debating how to divide the credit for defeating Banero, and while they think should be equal, Eyelashes claims he does not think Glasses deserves a fair share, for he is incompetent.\nLater on, the Blizzard Group is shown fighting a mysterious being called Demonic Fan, who is capable of creating strong winds. Claiming they cannot beat it, Fubuki then appears, telling them with confidence that she will take care of the rest, and that they can go home, causing them relief and the desire to get up cheer her on. Glasses then thinks of how he has changed after meeting someone with an unusual ability like Fubuki, who uses supernatural abilities to defeat mysterious beings, which is very uncommon even among heroes, and that her qualities and abilities are way above the average level.\nFubuki then proceeds to attack the Demonic Fan with her Hell Storm, but is swiftly defeated, along with the rest of the Blizzard Group. Glasses,was the only one still standing. After thinking he is doomed, he is then blown away along with a part of the wall by Tatsumaki. She then proceeds to ask Glasses if he is a friend of her sister's, from her B-Class group. He replies that he is just her subordinate and Tatsumaki insults him and breaks his spirit. Demonic Fan begins to attack Tatsumaki, but she is capable of blocking. Tatsumaki notices the creatures ability, and comments that, considering her sister's level of power, she can see why she lost.\nShe then proceeds to disassemble the creature and leave, carrying along her sister with her psychic power. Glasses then notes of how much stronger Tatsumaki is than him. Remembering the insult he received earlier, he starts complaining about how he cannot fight without special powers and how \"unfair\" society is, claiming that even though he trained more than anyone, without special powers, he stands no chance. Saitama then walks to Glasses and tells him that he came because he heard on the news that a mysterious being appeared in the area. Glasses unable to recognize the hero, thinking he is some unknown C-Class, tells him he is too late and that it has been taken care of, to which Saitama replies that it is still moving. \nGlasses notices it trying to reassemble itself and notes that it can probably only be beaten by destroying it's propeller. Saitama proceeds to take care of the monster, but Glasses tries to stop him by telling him that he stands no chance and that he should run away. While Saitama tells him that he'll be fine because he is strong, Glasses replies saying that he cannot, and that even he himself, who trained so hard, was no match for it, and that there's a limit to what normal people are capable of. Demonic Fan attacks, but is swiftly destroyed by Saitama, who was bothered by the freezing wind. Saitama then tells Glasses that he just hasn't trained enough, and that he should not mope around and just move forward. Glasses, unable to believe that Saitama has become so strong by training, thinks that Saitama is the son of a millionaire that has received some special training, but his theory is shattered when he hears him talking about a special sale he has to go to.\nLater on, two men from the Blizzard Group are apparently talking about Glasses, and how he quit the group while continuing his work as a professional hero. Thinking he has no chance against them, they think that he will quit being a hero soon while Glasses is seen jogging behind them.",

      "title": "Giant Meteor",
      "brief_summary": "A giant meteor threatens Z-City. At the Hero Association branch, only Genos and Bang remain. .Genos and Metal Knight fail to stop it, but Saitama arrives, punches it apart, and leaves as debris destroys parts of the city.",
      "long_summary": "Genos reads out the news that Saitama went from last to the 342th place. Saitama is not impressed by it and asks what Genos has been doing. Genos explains that he ranked 17th, but 6th in popular votes, much to Saitama's shock. Genos reads, without embarrassment, some commentaries of others about him that wrote their impressions after looking at one picture of him. Despite that, Genos exclaims that he has yet to meet someone as astounding as his teacher, to which Saitama is creeped about it. While they are talking, miles above them near Earth, a giant meteor is on impact route towards the planet. Genos is called to go the Hero Association for some unknown reason. Genos arrives at the Z-City Branch, with a suitcase, where he meets Bang. Genos recognizes Bang as the 3rd ranked S-Class hero. Bang explains that everyone from the Hero Association evacuated, as all S-Class heroes were called to go there, and they are the only two remaining. Genos wonders why, which Bang continues to explain that everyone is preoccupied or didn't bother, since they were ordered by the Hero Association for an unreasonable Dragon level disaster task. Bang was ordered to stop the impact of the meteor, which could wipe out Z-City, and by protecting the people from the meteor will make the Hero Association's name rise.\nHowever, Bang claims it to be impossible and advises Genos to evacuate. Genos still stays and asks if the citizens were informed. Bang explains that half an hour ago, they that tried to estimate the point of impact and will announce an evacuation notice. Despite all that, Bang shows a fearless expression of the coming panic. The alarm signals, and Genos wonders what Bang is going to do. Bang is going to stay and is going to protect his dojo. As he turns around, he notices Genos already left the building. Above them the meteor destroys a satellite near orbit, heading closer to the Earth.\nThe warning signal to evacuate, shocked the citizens and are left without hope. Genos leaps from the rooftops and notes that the meteor will also destroy the outskirts of Z-City. He decides to test his prototype, and activates his suitcase which shows the words \"Arms Mode\". He throws the suitcase in the air, which forms into a set pair of arms and attaches it to his arms and lands on a rooftop nearby the point of impact. Genos wonders if he can do some damage with his incineration cannons and hopes to protect his teacher. As he prepares himself, a huge robot flies above him towards the point of impact of the meteor.\nThe mechanical robot flies towards a building and lands on it. Genos approaches the robot and wonders if it is Bofoi.\nGenos pleads for Bofoi's assistance in destroying the meteor, but Bofoi refuses, stating that the only reason he is there is to test out a new weapon system. Bofoi then goes on to reveal that what Genos is talking to is just a remote-controlled robot and that his real body is a safe distance away from the imminent impact site and he would rather be called by his hero name \"Metal Knight.\" At that point the meteor roars closer and Genos jumps off to another building. He has calculated to be the point of impact, as he is doing this, Bofoi lets off a volley of large missiles which hit the meteor, cause a large explosion but don't stop the meteor at all.\nGenos' mind starts racing about how to destroy the meteor when Bang shows up and calms him down. A picture of Saitama runs through Genos' head and he rips his hoodie off and opens his chest plate revealing a 'core' which he then pulls out and attaches into the bicep of his left arm. He then tells Bang to get down and launches a massive attack on the meteor. Genos attack proves too little to stop the meteor and he drains himself of energy and falls to the ground. At this point, Saitama shows up and asks Bang to take care of Genos and then promptly launches himself headlong towards the meteor. He quickly arrives at the meteor and punches himself through it, the meteor cracking up and exploding in his wake.\nThe pieces of the meteor then start to rain on Z-City, destroying a bunch of buildings, including the one Genos and Bang are on. Saitama then lands, looks around, and nonchalantly walks away.",

      "long_summary": "Three days after the Meteor incident Saitama and Genos are relaxing in their apartment watching the news about the devastation the meteor fragments caused. Genos states that if the Hero Association had asked Saitama to help in the first place then the damage would have been reduced. After a brief discussion, Genos reveals that the incident raised their hero rankings: Saitama went from Class-C rank 342 to rank 5, Genos went from Class-S rank 17 to rank 16, and even Bofoi went up in rank from Class-S rank 7 to rank 6. Saitama is severely shocked by the jump in his position. After another brief discussion about Disaster Levels, Saitama decides to go for a walk.\nAs Saitama is walking around Z-City, taking note of the destruction, he is accosted by Tanktop Tiger. Tiger accuses Saitama of taking credit for the meteor incident that he did not deserve. Saitama blows off these accusations, which angers Tiger, who then calls out his brother. Tanktop Black Hole then makes his entrance and the two brothers then accuse Saitama of cheating again. Saitama seems rather put off by this and asks the two what they plan on doing about it. Tiger starts to threaten Saitama with violence but is cut off by his brother who states that he knows the cruelest way to punish Saitama. Black Hole then takes a deep breath and in an extremely loud voice starts calling out Saitama, stating that he's to blame for the destruction of the town. As he goes on like this, citizens from the area start to gather on the group. Eventually, some of the citizens start to join in. At that point, Black Hole calls on Saitama to resign, which the citizens agree too.\nAs this is happening, Bang is watching nearby from the roof of a building. He expresses his disappointment in the citizens and states that he'd rather see Saitama resign from the Hero Association than to see him corrupted by it. At this point, Black Hole goes to make his \"decisive\" move. He acts shocked and acts like Saitama made a move to start attacking the citizens. He and Tiger then step forward and state that they will \"protect\" the citizens by taking Saitama down. At this point Bang leaves, stating that he'd rather not watch a \"public execution.\" Tanktop Tiger then steps forward and challenges Saitama first.\nHe charges forward only to be casually knocked off into the distance by Saitama. Black Hole, enraged by this jumps forward and grabs Saitama's hands, only to fall to his knees due to the pain of having his hands being crushed by Saitama. He starts apologizing profusely, stating that he lied and that he gives up. Saitama interrupts him at this point, saying to everyone in the area that it was, in fact, his fault that the destruction was his fault and that if anyone had a problem with it that they should say it to his face. Someone tries to interrupt, but Saitama cuts him off stating that he is not a hero for the people's admiration, he does it because he feels like it. Several days later a Mysterious Being is seen walking up from the ocean.",

It declares itself to be one of the Seafolk, and that the humans are to surrender the surface to them at once. His rampage is short lived as Saitama arrives on the scene and dispatches him quickly. Later on, a large wave crashes to shore, bringing with it more Seafolk who then head into the city and start to attack. A citizen is grabbed by one of the Seafolk, but is quickly saved by the A-Class hero Stinger, who then challenges the rest of the Seafolk to battle.\nThe scene changes to Saitama and Genos relaxing in their apartment. Genos is doing dishes and commenting on their recent rises in rank, stating that Saitama could soon be moved up to B-Class, and mentions that the current Rank 1 C-Class hero has been in his position for more than half a year already. At that point, Genos receives a call from the Hero Association stating that the Seafolk had attacked J-City. He mentions this to Saitama who then turns on the news to check on the situation. The news shows a battered Stinger still facing off against the Seafolk. Saitama, now serious, states they need to get there as fast as possible.\nAn exhausted and battered Stinger stands before several large Seafolk. They tell him to give up, that all his supporters had left and that he was going to die there. Stinger blows off these jabs and states that now that he is by himself he can go all out. One of the Seafolk sends an attack at Stinger who meets it with an attack of his own that blasts a hole through the Seafolk. Leaping through the whole he uses another attack and dispatches the last three Seafolk. He lands and starts to celebrate his victory only to be immediately taken out by the Deep Sea King.\nD-Pad is driving toward J-City with his truck along with Funeral Suspenders, Studless, Skunk Boy Gasmask, Hyottoko, Food Battler Futotsu and many other C-Class heroes, when they were suddenly outrun by Saitama and Genos.",

      "long_summary": "Speed-o'-Sound Sonic is seen being restrained by various special equipment invented by the Hero Association as the security guards bring him to his cell. Sonic is brought to the \"Smelly Lid Prison,\" a detention facility for the most vicious criminals. The senior inmates attempt to have some fun with Sonic, but quickly realize that they have underestimated him. Sonic declares to the other prisoners that he will kill all of them to make his stay at the prison enjoyable. Angered, the other prisoners start to fight Sonic one on one. However, this quickly angers the boss of the prison and all of the prisoners, except Sonic, try to better their behavior. It is then revealed that it was the boss of the prison that brought order to the prison and forced the prisoners to cooperate and behave. The Smelly Lid Old Man tells Sonic that Puri-Puri Prisoner is a homosexual and turned himself in to the prisoner in order to \"legally\" harass boys. After the lecture, Puri-Puri Prisoner finds out that Stinger is in danger on the news and decides to go and save him. Puri-Puri Prisoner escapes the prison by making a large hole through the wall. Sonic uses the hole to escape as well.",

      "long_summary": "Mumen Rider has just arrived at J-City and is talking on the phone with the Hero Association. He is told to rush to the emergency center. As Mumen Rider rides off to the shelter, he drops his phone. Saitama ends up picking the phone and talks to one of the Hero Association assistants. The assistant is initially reluctant to tell Saitama where the monster is, but after looking over Saitama's record, he changes his mind. The heroes at the emergency shelter are quickly defeated by the Deep Sea King. However, Genos soon arrives and starts fighting with the Deep Sea King.\nGenos launches the Deep Sea King out of the emergency shelter, but also creates another large hole. Unfortunately, the Deep Sea King immediately recovers from Genos' punch and retaliates by attacking Genos when he was distracted by the crowd. The Deep Sea King is able to rip Genos' arm off and knock him towards a wall. Genos tells everyone to get out of shelter while he holds off the Deep Sea King. During their battle, one of the children cheers on Genos, this annoys the Sea King and causes him to launch a spit of acid at the child. Genos is just barely able to get in front of the spit in time preventing it from harming the child.",

Sea King expresses his surprise at the fact that Genos sacrificed himself to save a little girl. Just as he is about to deal the finishing blow, Mumen Rider attacks him from behind with his Justice Crash, by literally throwing his bicycle at the Sea King.\nAs Genos attempts to stop Mumen Rider, he attacks the Sea King but is easily parried and smashed to the ground a few times before getting thrown away. Sea King then returns to finish off Genos, but Mumen Rider intervenes again by grabbing the Sea King from behind. Mumen Rider admits that he knows better than anyone that he has no chance of beating the Sea King, however, he states that it does not matter if he stands a chance or not, he has to fight him since there is no one else who will. This causes the people to start cheering for him and he gets pumped up, but is knocked out by the Sea King with a punch to his face. Saitama suddenly appears at the scene and grabs Mumen Rider before he falls to the ground. Saitama praises Mumen Rider's fight and sets him to the ground, he spots Genos lying there and is surprised that he is still alive, despite his melted state. He then tells Genos to wait a little while longer while he takes care of the 'sea freak'. Sea King, who has transformed into his true form, tells Saitama that he can hear him and punches him in the back of his head. Saitama, however, appears to be unaffected.",

      "long_summary": "Saitama stands between the unconscious Mumen Rider and the Deep Sea King as the citizens in the shelter look on. The citizens are worried because Saitama is only a C-Class and doubt his ability to do anything against the Sea King. Sea King introduces himself to Saitama, declaring himself to be the ruler of the sea and states that he stands at the top of the pyramids of all living things. Saitama then blows off Deep Sea King's boasts and asks him to hurry up. Deep Sea King, enraged, throws a punch at Saitama. Saitama returns with his own punch, which blows a hole through Deep Sea King's torso. The citizens look on in awe and confusion as the Sea King falls to the ground. The citizens then go into a frenzy of disbelief, stating how powerful Saitama is, until one citizen, in particular, starts causing trouble. He states that the Mysterious Being probably was not all that strong and that even if he was that the other heroes had weakened the Sea King before Saitama arrived. He then starts taking jabs at the heroes, stating that they were useless and weak.\nHearing this, Saitama begins to laugh and proclaims his luck that the other heroes had been there to weaken the beast and that he'd managed to take all the credit. He then turns to the citizens and tells them that they'd better tell everyone that he'd beaten it and that they better not snitch on him. The citizens then start talking amongst themselves, saying how the other Heroes had helped and that Saitama is just a cheater. Saitama makes one more jab at himself which causes the citizens to give their gratitude to the wounded heroes who had fought the beast rather than Saitama. Genos worries about Saitama position as a hero and declares if Saitama was in a tight spot, he will be by his side. Speed-o'-Sound Sonic returns equipped to the battle scene to fight the Sea King, unaware that the monster was defeated. The scene shifts to G-City, where the great oracle Shibabawa predicts a great catastrophe, the greatest of the era and states that the Earth itself is in danger.",

Saitama brought into an interview to ask him whether he wants to remain in C-Class or move up to B-Class.\nSaitama decides to move up to B-Class and is given a psychoanalysis test. Overhead of the interview, there are several Hero Association staff observing and discussing Saitama. They discuss whether or not he is a sham. After a short discussion, Sweet Mask is seen as an adviser on whether or not Saitama should move up. Sweet Mask replies that they do not need him for such a trivial task as promoting someone to B-Class. Sweet Mask additionally states that he only wants a say in promoting people to Class A and higher as they tend to have a strong influence on the association's image. After the interview, Saitama goes to a nearby food stand to eat. There he finds Mumen Rider and it is revealed that it was he who wrote the thank you letter to Saitama. The two share a smile and order mozuku.\n",

      "title": "What Can't Be Bought | Volume 5 Extras",
      "brief_summary": "Saitama, low on money, fails to buy a drink he wants. After defeating bank robbers and rescuing a child, Genos gives him the drink\u2014only for Saitama to find it awful and dump the rest on Mumen Rider.",
      "long_summary": "Saitama is at the bank, surprised to learn his account balance is only 20 Yen, but deals with it.\nLater in the park, after seemingly defeating a monster, he is dealt with a dilemma, as he has only 90 in total, and wants to try a drink that costs 120, that is in the vending machine in front of him, so he a bit unsuccessfully tries to look for loose change. Two personnel's walking by, notice the dead monster, wondering what it is doing there and thinking they should block it in case it's poisonous. After blocking it with \"police tape\" the two are noticed by passing children, and are revealed to be the C-Class Heroes D-Pad and Funeral Suspenders, the two heroes then proceed to the nearby vending machine, where D-Pad buys the Red Bean Jelly Cider that Saitama wanted, and after finishing it, D-Pad unsuccessfully tries to Jump Shot the empty can into a nearby trash can. The two heroes then leave, while Saitama drops the empty cider can into the trash can properly.\nSaitama then returns to the bank, claiming he is 10 short, just then a gang of robbers \"Cow's Stomach\", which is led by the A-Class Criminal Bull-Bull, try to rob the bank, knocking out the security guard and even taking a boy hostage. The two heroes from earlier then appear, successfully beating the small fry, but are then easily beaten by their leader Bull-Bull, calling them scum and leaving. As they are leaving ABC Bank, the other criminals are wondering about their fellow men, to which Bull-Bull replies to leave them because they don't need any weaklings with them. The criminals then leave in a van, but not before kidnapping a child hostage.\nAs they ride, the crooks ask their leader about the child, to which he replies they have to get off the trail of their pursuers first, and that they'll leave him at the mountains. Bull-Bull notices that they are driving towards the city, to which the driver replies that he has lost control of the car.\nSaitama drops off the van in the park, and is noticed by Bull-Bull, who is angered and asks Saitama if he was responsible for their change in destination, to which Saitama replies that he cannot let them steal the Bank's money, for his money is there too. Bull-Bull then attacks but is quickly defeated, along with the rest of his gang. Afterwards, Saitama is worried about the bags of cash, for he cannot leave it in the park. However, he does not want to look like a robber himself by carrying them. Saitama is then thanked by the small child who was kidnapped, who even tries to give him his money in return for saving him, but Saitama then returns the money to the child, telling him he should use it for something more important.\nFinishing his story to Genos, Saitama is given a can of Red Bean Jelly Cider by Genos, who ordered a whole box of them, after seeing Saitama glare at it, in the vending machine. Saitama learns from comments how wealthy Genos is. As Saitama drinks the cider but comments on how badly it tastes (which he thought so from the start), Genos then tells him it expires in 2 years.\nAftermath: Saitama sees Mumen Rider, who is on patrol. Saitama asks him if he is thirsty, to which he replies he is. Eventually it is shown that Saitama gave him all the Red Bean Jelly Ciders he had, but it also burdened Mumen Rider, as it is harder for him to pedal his bike.",

Unfortunately, they decline Bang's offer. Charanko is angered by their decline and challenges to fight them. Genos quickly defeats Charanko and states that he underwhelmed by the lack of skilled fighters in Bang's dojo. Bang explains that his dojo used to be full of skilled disciples, but they were all disabled by Garou, Bang's best disciple in the past. Bang further tells them that he expelled Garou after giving him a beating. Saitama acknowledges Bang's strength; a statement which Charanko would then scorn Saitama for because of Saitama's lack of knowledge of Bang's popularity.\nAfter Charanko's constant talk, a Hero Association employee arrives at Bang's front door informing Bang and the others that an emergency summons has been issued to S-Class heroes. Bang, Saitama, and Genos leave for the meeting, while Charanko is left to watch over the dojo. At the headquarters, they are greeted by Atomic Samurai. Atomic Samurai declines Saitama's offer for a handshake, stating that he will greet him when he becomes a S-Class hero. Tatsumaki suddenly starts shouting at Saitama and belittling him only to have Genos inform Saitama that she is rank two in the S-Class and is an Esper. At the meeting, each S-Class member gives off their thoughts on the matter. Saitama asks for tea.",

Before explaining the situation, he warns them that once they start listening to what he has to say, they will be confined to the room until the meeting ends. Metal Bat interrupts Sitch, stating that he had to skip his sister's piano concert to attend this meeting, and threatens to destroy the headquarters building if Sitch does not have anything important to say. Sitch announces that the great prophet, Shibabawa, is dead. Most of the heroes are shocked to hear this news. Zombieman asks whether she was murdered, to which Sitch replies that she just died from choking on cough drops. Superalloy Darkshine asserts that the Hero Association brought them to tell them that they must now prevent disasters without Shibabawa's help. Sitch states that Darkshine is wrong and that she has always only predicted a fraction of all disasters. Saitama asks Puri-Puri Prisoner who Shibabawa is.\nPuri-Puri Prisoner tells Saitama that she was a great prophet who could predict the exact timing of disasters, such as natural disasters and monster attacks. Finally, Sitch states that the real problem was that her final prophecy was a note stating the Earth is in trouble. Child Emperor then tries to make an excuse to leave. However, he is only mocked by Sitch, stating that Child Emperor is nothing more than a child if he does not comprehend the danger of this matter. Additionally, Sitch states that the disaster is above Dragon and will happen within half a year. Watchdog Man comments that they cannot do much to prevent the disaster. Saitama remarks that the prophecy might come true sooner than expected. Suddenly, the headquarters comes under fire from Skyfolk. Outside the Sky King prepares his attack with his henchmen. However, the Skyfolk are then attacked by an unseen being.",

      "brief_summary": "A giant alien ship destroys A-City, leaving only Hero Association HQ intact. Saitama leaps onto the ship, fending off its massive weapons and killing an alien inside. Meanwhile, heroes fight the regenerating alien Melzargard, with Atomic Samurai, Bang, Metal Bat, and Puri-Puri Prisoner joining forces. As the battle rages, the aliens realize Saitama has infiltrated their ship.",
      "long_summary": "A large spaceship is seen flying over A-City, where it stops and proceeds to destroy the entire city. Sky King is then seen, dead, with his body falling apart as Melzargard, a grotesque alien creature with several heads and wings comments to itself on killing the Sky King, and the destruction caused by the ship. Iaian then crawls out of the rubble and witnesses the state of destruction of A-City, the only thing left standing is the Hero Association's headquarters. He then notices the giant ship above him, but only looks for a second before the large monster appears behind him and attempts to crush his head. The alien only crushes his helmet, its occupant having moved safely away. Iaian comments on how there would be no way he would not notice the monsters killing intent and then proceeds to attack it.\nSitch is screaming, and after seeing that A-City was destroyed in an instant, he is certain the \"earth is in danger\" prophecy had come true. Bang asks Sitch why the Hero Association building is still standing, to which he is answered with the fact that Metal Knight had built it, and that it is much stronger than an average shelter, Metal Bat then notes that because it is built like a bomb shelter, the place has no windows. The heroes are preparing to leave to deal the threat outside, and just as Genos is about to ask Saitama to join them, he notices that his master is not there and that a hole in the \"impenetrable fortress\" ceiling has been made, apparently all the way to its roof.\nSaitama is then seen on the roof, preparing to deal with the threat in front of him, he then leaps towards the spaceship and is shot with a colossal-size bullet, which he is able to dodge, and is also relieved, due to the fact that if the weapon was a laser beam, it would've burned off his clothes. Saitama is then once more shot with gigantic bullets, but repels them and sends them back to their own ship.\nMeanwhile, Iaian is still fighting  Melzargard, who appears invulnerable to his attacks. The alien then retaliates and demolishes the area behind Iaian, as well as his arm. The alien then proceeds to split himself, into 5 different forms.\nThe creature then proceeds to split itself into more individuals and proceed to attack Iaian, however, they are stopped by Atomic Samurai who shows concern for Iaian's injuries. The creature regenerates, and Atomic Samurai engages it in a fight. Once it seems that Atomic Samurai has gained the upper hand the individuals seeming to be excited at the prospect that someone can match them in power. Bang, Metal Bat and Puri-Puri Prisoner arrive to aid Atomic Samurai take on Melzargard.\nS-Class heroes are then seen debating on how to deal with the flying ship, Superalloy Darkshine suggests King takes on the ship to which King replies that he is unable to do so, hearing this angers Tatsumaki who then decides to stop the ship by herself.\nSaitama is then seen having already boarded the ship in an altercation with Groribas who is easily killed in one single punch before even given the chance to approach Saitama. He then decides to destroy the ship from the inside much to the dismay of Geryuganshoop who is shocked by the power Saitama possesses. The leader of the aliens then appears and is then shocked after learning that Groribas was killed by Saitama.\nAs the S-Class heroes battle the monster, Melzargard was struck by Bang and decide to contact the ship to prepare the cannons. He creates a small flying head to contact the ship, but the head was struck by Metal Bat. Geryuganshoop then contacts Melzargard to inform him someone intruded into the ship.",
